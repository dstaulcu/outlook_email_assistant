# Enterprise Office.js Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Solved:**
- **Office.js CDN blocking**: `appsforoffice.microsoft.com` causing 20+ second delays
- **Enterprise firewall concerns**: External CDNs often blocked at work
- **Air-gapped networks**: No external internet access allowed

## ✅ **Solution Implemented:**
- **Self-hosted Office.js**: Downloaded and hosted on our CloudFront
- **No external dependencies**: Everything served from `d343wke1xouc9b.cloudfront.net`
- **Enterprise compatible**: Works in restricted network environments

## 📂 **Technical Details:**
- **Office.js file**: 65KB hosted at `https://d343wke1xouc9b.cloudfront.net/office.js`
- **Loading strategy**: On-demand when email features needed
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if Office.js fails

## 🚀 **Performance Benefits:**
- **Instant load**: No blocking external CDN calls
- **Fast Office.js**: Served from same CloudFront as app
- **Predictable**: No dependency on Microsoft's CDN availability

## 🏢 **Enterprise Readiness:**
- **Firewall friendly**: Single domain dependency
- **Air-gap compatible**: Can be fully self-contained
- **Compliance ready**: No external data leakage
- **Audit friendly**: All resources under your control

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. Test new self-hosted version
2. If still slow, Office.js itself may need optimization
3. For work deployment, configure work environment in `config/environments.js`

## 🔧 **Work Environment Setup:**
When ready for work deployment:
1. Update `config/environments.js` with work S3 bucket
2. Deploy to work environment: `npm run deploy:work`
3. Use work CloudFront URL in manifest
4. All dependencies will be internal to your organization
